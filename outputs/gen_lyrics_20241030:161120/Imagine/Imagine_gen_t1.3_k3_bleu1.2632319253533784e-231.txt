i'm standing on some grass in
a water in your hand
i hear the voices
a little closer now
and i can feel the music
listen to the river flow
i'm standing on some grass for
i hear the river breeze
listen to what you say to me
i'm standing at the shore
and i can feel the music
i can taste the water flow
to the wind and the water
in a little river down
when i look underneath them
in a sea of people down
