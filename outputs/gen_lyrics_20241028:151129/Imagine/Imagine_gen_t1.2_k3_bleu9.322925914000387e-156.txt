imagine how it felt up
imagine how to make
i couldn't live up
imagine how hard you try
imagine all my dreams up
imagine you imagine
imagine how it felt up to
i couldn't make you feel
imagine you never loved me
imagine all my dreams
imagine all my dreams up
imagine all my dreams to come
to imagine how it felt to
and imagine that you and i would understand
how this feels so beautiful
