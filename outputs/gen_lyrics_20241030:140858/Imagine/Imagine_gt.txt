imagine there's no heaven
it's easy if you try
no hell below us
above us only sky
imagine all the people
living for today you oh
imagine there's no countries
it isn't hard to do
nothing to kill or die for
and no religion too
imagine all the people
living life in peace you oh
you may say i'm a dreamer
but i'm not the only one
i hope someday you'll join us
and the world will be as one
