imagine how it felt up
imagine how to make
i couldn't live up
imagine how hard you try
imagine all this feeling
imagine how it felt up to it
imagine how hard you tried
imagine how it felt to be
imagine how hard you tried to
imagine what i've seen
imagine all this feeling
imagine that i'd feel to live
for a moment of glory
in the arms of glory and
that i could understand
and the feeling all of mine
